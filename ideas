*more command line params
*more logging control
*redirect error to logs
*Log to user
    Ability to send all log messages to me, again so we can work with treebot across Irc
*Change logging level on the fly
*Ability to log all errors/crashes (replace die and croak)

    Try to restart if we crash
*If we update something through git and it crashes (syntax errors?)
    reset --hard <latest-working-commit>
    and restart
