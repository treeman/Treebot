# Todo
*Better return handling for plugin handling
    For _all commands return how many plugins were affected
    Log error if something bad happens and better returning messages
    If nothing is loaded show a message
    Fix unload_all load_all, and reload_all!
*Git pull from <somewhere>
    Check if core files have changed or just plugins files, then reload them
    Otherwise we need to restart the script, from the new source
    I heard that fork exec might work? Maybe? Might want to boot up a new script then?
*Think about migrating the plugin handling to another file? Might be worth to
    declutter Irc.pm? It's growing quite large.
*Protect the other shared threadings perhaps? But perhaps they're fine where they are.

# Bugs
*^C hangs on stdin getline, quits after enter (only sometimes?)
*Plugin::run_tests couldn't be run from a different thread (CoreTests::run_tests)
    My solution was to run the tests from the main thread
    It's strange because threaded cmd_workers can use Plugin functions just fine
