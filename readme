# Todo
*Correctly reload plugin classes
*Better return handling for plugin handling
    For "_all" commands return how many plugins were affected
    Log error if something bad happens and better returning messages
    If nothing is loaded show a message
*Change logging level dynamically
*Working tell
    Must have a way of checking if a user is online or not
    Otherwise bind to join
    Store/Retrieve from file on startup/shutdown
*Anti flood when sending a lot of info
*torrent
    Add option to list all torrents (without flooding)
    Add option to remove individual torrent
    Add total upload/download
    Add individual torrent stat
*mi insults retorts
    Do something more when you give a successful retort

# Bugs
*^C hangs on stdin getline, quits after enter (only sometimes?)
*Plugin::run_tests couldn't be run from a different thread (CoreTests::run_tests)
    My solution was to run the tests from the main thread
    It's strange because threaded cmd_workers can use Plugin functions just fine
*Plugins don't really reload, the classes are just the same. But the files are being reparsed..!
*Character encodings are off.
